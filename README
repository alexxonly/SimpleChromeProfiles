README / Help with Simple Customization

I was inspired to create my first workflow to open a new window in a specific Chrome Profile since I work between several profiles and have certain permissions in certain profiles.

This simple workflow was inspired by @Balverine commenting on another Chrome profiles workflow that no longer works.

--How It Works--

This is a very simple workflow that will open different chrome profiles using a simple Alfred command. Each time you use the command, a new chrome browser window will open for the specified profile.

The workflow is built with pre-defined arguments 1, 2 and 3. "cp 1" opens the first chrome profile (usually called "Default" by chrome), "cp 2" the second (called Profile 1 by chrome) and so on.

[cmd arg] = [chrome profile name]
cp 1 = Default
cp 2 = Profile 1
cp 3 = Profile 2

This workflow will require some simple customization to function properly with your Chrome-assigned profile names IF they differ from the above or you want to change the associated argument (i.e. you want Profile 2 to open with cp 1)

--Find your Chrome Profile Name--

In the workflow, you will need to change the [Profile #] in each Run Script to match the Chrome-created profile name you want to open. The "profile name" used in this workflow is NOT the chrome profile name you created/defined; it is the name in the profile pathway and assigned by Chrome.

To find the proper profile name for each Chrome Profile:
Step 1: open chrome://version/ while in each Chrome profile you have

Step 2: Find "Profile Path" and copy the end of the pathway: /Users/[YOUR USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Profile 5 
In the above example, the proper profile name is: "Profile 5"

Step 3: In the workflow, you will need to update the profile name in each /bin/zsh to match yours.

For example, in the top /bin/zsh:
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --profile-directory="Default"
changes to
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --profile-directory="Profile 5"

I hope those of you will multiple profiles will find this useful and others will take it and improve on the functionality. I'm sure the workflow could be expanded to do a lot more things.
